# SemiAdv
This repository contains code for "SemiAdv: Query-Efficient Black-Box Adversarial Attack with Unlabeled Data" in PyTorch. We referred to the code in "https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar/" and "https://github.com/tianyizhou/MixMatch-pytorch". At present, the open code is not perfect, and we will continue to improve it.
